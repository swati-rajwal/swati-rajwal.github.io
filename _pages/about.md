I'm a second-year CS Ph.D. student at Emory University and recipient of the Woman in Natural Science Fellowship. Before Emory, I was a Researcher at <a href="https://www.c2d3.cam.ac.uk/directory/34851/swati-rajwal" target="_blank">Cambridge</a> University's <a href="https://cbl-website.onrender.com/" target="_blank">Computational and Biological Learning (CBL)</a> Lab with Prof. Mancini. I also worked as an RA at Sa√Ød Business School (Oxford University) with <a href="https://enspire.ox.ac.uk/article/natalia-efremova-co-founder-of-deep-planet" target="_blank">Prof. Natalia Efremova</a>.

My Master's at NSUT was supported by the AICTE PG Scholarship by Govt. of India and I received a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7108505289506627584/" target="_blank">Vice-Chancellor's Gold Medal</a> for academic excellence. My industry experience ranges from being a Software Engineer at Eaton Corp. to an R&D Senior Analyst at Accenture Tech Lab.
