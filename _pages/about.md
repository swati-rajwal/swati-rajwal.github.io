I am a first-year Computer Science PhD student at Emory University and recipient of the Woman in Natural Science Fellowship. Before Emory, I was a Researcher at <a href="https://neuroscience.cam.ac.uk/member/srajwal/" target="_blank">Cambridge</a> University's <a href="https://cbl-website.onrender.com/" target="_blank">Computational and Biological Learning (CBL)</a> Lab with Prof. Flavia Mancini. A bit before that, I worked as an RA at SaÃ¯d Business School (University of Oxford), supervised by <a href="https://www.research.ox.ac.uk/researchers/natalia-efremova" target="_blank">Prof. Natalia Efremova</a>.

My Master's degree at NSUT was supported by the AICTE PG Scholarship by Govt. of India and I received a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7108505289506627584/" target="_blank">Vice-Chancellor's Gold Medal</a> for my academic performance. My industry experience ranges from being a Software Engineer at Eaton Corp. to an R&D Senior Analyst at Accenture Technology Lab.

# Research Summary
