I am pursuing a CS Ph.D. at Emory University and recipient of the Woman in Natural Science Fellowship. Before Emory, I was a Researcher at <a href="https://womeninneuroscience.wixsite.com/winuk/post/bridging-brains-and-bytes-a-computer-scientist-s-role-in-neuroscience" target="_blank">Cambridge</a> University's <a href="https://cbl-website.onrender.com/" target="_blank">Computational and Biological Learning (CBL)</a> Lab with Prof. Mancini. I also worked as an RA at SaÃ¯d Business School (Oxford University) with <a href="https://www.research.ox.ac.uk/researchers/natalia-efremova" target="_blank">Prof. Natalia Efremova</a>.

My industry experience ranges from being a Software Engineer at Eaton Corp. to an R&D Senior Analyst at Accenture Technology Lab.
