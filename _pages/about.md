I am currently enrolled in a Doctoral Degree in Computer Science & Informatics at Emory University. Prior to Emory, I was a Research Assistant at the University of Cambridge working with [Prof. Flavia Mancini](https://www.noxlab.org/). I finished my Masters and Bachelors in Computer Science from NSUT and IGDTUW, respectively. My Masters degree was supported by AICTE PG Scholarship by Govt. of India and I received a Vice-Chancellor's Gold Medal for my academic performance. My industry experience ranges from being a Software Engineer at Eaton Corp. to an R&D Senior Analyst at Accenture Technology Lab.
